# What is this
A python implementation and a scalability analysis of the algorithms in the paper [Scheduling activities with time-dependent durations and resource consumptions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721009838?)

# How to use
`TDASPR.ipynb` Is the main notebook, there you can find what has been done, the problem definition and how to use the algorithms implemented, you can think of it as a tutorial.  
In `./src` you can find classes and functions used in the above notebook
